                        <p class="typewriter-effect">Hi, friends!! 👋😊</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect">Today we’re going to remember what we’ve already learned about Artificial Intelligence! 👋😊</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">👾 Artificial Intelligence is when a machine seems to have a little head that thinks.</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">But be careful: Artificial Intelligence is not a person!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">It doesn’t have feelings like we do!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="typewriter-page disabled">
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">🤫 Last time we were together, you learned that we shouldn’t tell everything to Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">We keep secrets and important things to ourselves!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">👩‍🏫 We also learned that it’s us who teach the computer!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">We’re the ones who show Artificial Intelligence what is right and what is wrong.</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">It learns from the examples we give!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="typewriter-page disabled">
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">🎲 But that’s not the only way it learns... It can also learn through games, like the one we played today!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">It was fun, right?</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">In this game, you had to find the fastest path.</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">But it didn’t work on the first try...</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">And no one figured it out alone either!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">We set the rules, and you started to notice that some pieces were better than others to form the path.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="typewriter-page disabled">
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">After testing and trying again, you managed to find the best path!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">🟢 When you chose the right piece, the robot moved really fast!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">🔴 But when you chose the wrong piece, the robot moved very slowly...</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">It’s like the robot earns a star ✨ when it chooses correctly… and doesn’t get a star when it makes a mistake. That’s how it learns what’s best!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="typewriter-page disabled">
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">🧠 At the beginning, you made a few mistakes.</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">But after trying several combinations, you learned!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">And found the best path!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">Artificial Intelligence does the same thing!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">It tests... It fails... It tries again... And when it finds the best path... it learns! And follows that path whenever it needs to!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="typewriter-page disabled">
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">👏 Whew... you learned a lot today!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">Now you already know...</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">Artificial Intelligence learns by testing, making mistakes, and trying again... until it gets better!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">It remembers what worked — as if it were collecting clues to do better each time!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">And who helps it get started... is us! By creating the game’s rules! 🎲</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">🌟 Congratulations, little scientists! Until the next adventure!</p>
                        <p class="typewriter-effect img-text">Goodbye! 👋😄</p>
