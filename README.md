# AI-Learning-Lab
A game for teaching kids aged 6 to 7 about Artificial Intelligence.

It can be accessed online here: [Laboratório de IA](https://carolinabaptist.github.io/AI-Learning-Lab)

# Activity 1 Talking to Machines

The goal of this session is to introduce children to generative AI through virtual assistants and chatbots. In this activity, children interact with tools like Siri and ChatGPT by asking questions and creating stories, discovering that AI can generate meaningful and sometimes surprising responses. At the same time, they observe that AI is not perfect. It can misunderstand input or produce inaccurate information. This experience helps them reflect on both the capabilities and the limitations of generative AI.

Key concepts: Generative AI, AI limitations <br>
Material: Computer with Internet 

# Activity 2 Privacy and AI

This activity is designed to help children identify different spheres of privacy and reflect on the type of information they share with AI tools and the world. At the beginning of the session, we revisit the concept of AI and give examples of how it appears in everyday life. We also briefly introduce the idea of supervised learning. The main focus of this session is privacy, encouraging children to think critically about personal data, consent, and the implications of sharing information with intelligent systems.

Key concepts: Data privacy, AI in daily life, Supervised learning <br>
Material: Paper, Coloured pencils, Glue, Scissors, Computer with Internet, AI Learning Lab platform

The activity is available in Portuguese, English, and Hindi.

⚠️ Voice Disclaimer: The voice used in Activity 2 depends on your browser and computer settings. It may vary depending on the available voices and speech synthesis support in your system. As an alternative, the teacher can read the text aloud. This approach was chosen so that the activity can also be carried out offline, without depending on an internet connection.

All materials used and full alternative script are available in the folder Materials\Privacy-and-AI.

# Activity 3 Robot Race

In this activity, children are given a race track and small robots. Their challenge is to build the fastest path to win the race using puzzle pieces. The robot acts as an agent that makes decisions and interacts with its environment (the race track). The puzzle pieces form a set of predefined instructions that guide the robot's behavior.

As children place different puzzle pieces on the track, the robot responds with immediate feedback. For example, blue pieces make the robot move faster, while red pieces slow it down. Through trial and error, children learn how to improve their strategy by observing outcomes and adjusting their choices. They discover that to create the fastest path, they must maximize rewards, introducing them to the basic logic behind reinforcement learning.

To update the scoreboard, press 1 to give a point to team/player 1 and press 2 to give a point to player 2. There are currently 3 rounds.

Key concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Feedback, Reward, Penalty, Agent, Ambient, Algorithm <br>
Material: Race Track, Puzzles, Ozobots, Computer with internet, AI learning Lab, paper question marks

The activity is available in Portuguese and English.

# Activity 4 Teach, Mário!

In this activity, children teach a machine learning model to control a Mario character by creating custom input classes such as "right" and "up". Using a webcam, they take multiple photos to represent each class. Each hand gesture and glove color corresponds to a different movement in the game.

With the collected data, the children train a classification model and then test it using the webcam to see if it correctly recognizes the gestures. Once the model is validated, it is exported and integrated into a Mario game, allowing the children to play by moving Mario with colored gloves — using their own trained AI.

Key concepts: Classification, Training data, Labels, Training, Supervised learning, AI models, Evaluation <br>
Materials: pairs of gloves of different colours, google teachable machine, ai learning lab

# Activity 5 Sort It Out

The goal of this game is to correctly group animals based on shared characteristics. On the table, there is a board with three circles on each side and a set of cards featuring animal images.

The game begins when a participant presses a button to randomly select a grouping criterion, which is displayed on the computer screen. Example criteria include type of diet, main mode of locomotion, and number of legs.

The children are then given time to organize the cards into clusters according to the selected criterion. Through this activity, they explore how to identify patterns and group data without being told the exact rules — an intuitive introduction to unsupervised learning and clustering.

Key concepts: Unsupervised learning, Clustering, Pattern recognition <br>
